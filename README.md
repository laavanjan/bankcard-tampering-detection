# Bankcard Tampering Detection Project

## Overview
This project provides a solution for detecting tampered bank cards and IDs using computer vision techniques. Organizations can use this system to instantly verify whether employee-provided IDs (such as Aadhaar cards, PAN cards, or bank cards) are original or potentially tampered with, without relying solely on online verification systems.

## Key Features
- Instant visual verification of ID cards
- Comparison between uploaded image and original reference image
- Tampering detection through computer vision analysis
- Works with various ID types (bank cards, Aadhaar cards, PAN cards, etc.)

## Technical Approach
The system follows a 10-step process:

1. **Image Input**: Accept user-uploaded image
2. **Threshold Detection**: Find image threshold values
3. **Image Analysis**: Determine size and format
4. **Image Standardization**: Reshape and resize to match original reference
5. **Grayscale Conversion**: Convert images to grayscale
6. **Similarity Index Calculation**: Compute image similarity metrics
7. **Contour Detection**: Find and threshold image contours using IAM utils
8. **Bounding Rectangle**: Create rectangles around detected contours
9. **Visual Comparison**: Plot difference threshold, original and tampered images
10. **Decision Making**: Calculate similarity score to determine tampering likelihood

## Benefits
- Faster than online verification systems
- Visual tampering detection
- Reduced dependency on external verification services
- Instant results for ID authenticity checks

## Potential Applications
- Employee onboarding processes
- Financial institutions verifying customer IDs
- Government agencies validating official documents
- Any organization requiring ID verification

## Requirements
- Python environment
- Computer vision libraries (OpenCV, etc.)
- Image processing utilities

Note: The system is designed to work alongside (not replace) existing verification methods, providing an additional layer of security through visual inspection.
